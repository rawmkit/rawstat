RAWSTAT(1)

# NAME

rawstat - modular status bar for rawm or similar programs

# SYNOPSIS

*rawstat* [*-d* _delim_] [*-p*]

# DESCRIPTION

*rawstat* is a tiny utility for generating a status bar for *rawm*(1)
or similar programs.  There is an ability to generate status bar to
stdout, that may be useful for *dvtm*(1) and similar programs.

The status bar is made from text output from command‐line programs.
Commands are added and removed by editing _config.h_ file.

The options are as follows:

*-d* _delim_
	Set outputs delimiter.

*-p*
	Print status bar to stdout.

# CUSTOMIZATION

*rawstat* can be customized by creating a custom _config.h_ file and
(re)compiling the source code.  This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

# EXIT STATUS

*0* on success, and *>0* if an error occurs.

# SEE ALSO

*rawm*(1),
*rawmenu*(1),
