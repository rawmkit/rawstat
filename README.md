OVERVIEW
========

This repository contains `rawstat`, a tiny utility that generates a
status bar for `rawm(1)`, `dwm(1)` or similar programs.  There is an
ability to generate status bar to stdout, that may be useful for
`dvtm(1)`, `screen(1)` and similar programs.

This distribution is a fork of torrinfail's `dwmblocks` as of commit
a933ce0 (Thu Jan 6 2022) with the following differences:
  * fix compilation on DragonFlyBSD
  * add manual page in `scdoc(5)` format
  * suckless style build

See git log for complete/further differences.
